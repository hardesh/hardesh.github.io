					Hello! I'm Robotics Engineer at <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/getpeppermint/">Peppermint Robots</a>, 
					working on autonomous cleaning robots.
					<br><br>
					I graduated from BITS Pilani, Goa in Dec 2020, where I studied Electronics and Physics.  For my bachelor's thesis, I worked on motion 
					planning of aerial robots for exploration and visual search of geometrically constrained environments 
					such as mines and caves, under the guidance of <a href="http://www.kostasalexis.com/">Prof. Kostas Alexis.</a>					
					<br>
					During my undergraduate years, I was an active member of the <a href="https://erc-bpgc.github.io/">Electronics and Robotics club</a> 
					on our campus, and I was also part of the <a href="https://kratosbitsgoa.com/">autonomous mars rover team</a> 
					where I was responsible for developing the control and interfacing sub-system of the rover.
					<br><br>
					Iâ€™m currently interested in Robotics, particularly motion planning and perception.
					<br>
					Apart from my technical interests, I'm also into astronomy & astrophysics and PC gaming.
