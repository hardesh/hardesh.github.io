Developed a fall detection system using STM-32F103. Used MPU-6050 to get the inertial measurements. 
Data was sent to an app using a bluetooth module. 

I'll continue working on this project in the future whenever I get time. The results can be (probably) improved using 
deep learning based methods. 

Code can be found [here](https://github.com/hardesh/Fall-Detection-System).
