Developed the control sub-system of a rover for the [Indian Rover Chanllenge, 2020](https://southasia.marssociety.org/irc/).

Worked on the design of the robotic manipulator on the rover. Designed the controllers for the arm and the drive 
sub-systems. Also, worked on the interfacing of components. I was also an integral member in deciding the components on the
rover reponsible for the computation. 

Some of my work can be found [here](https://github.com/hardesh/urc_arm).  

Here the system acceptance review that was made for URC 2020:
